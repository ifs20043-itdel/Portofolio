## Courses

__Postman: The Complete Guide - REST API Testing__  
* is a comprehensive online course that focuses on using Postman as a tool for testing RESTful APIs. 
The course provides in-depth training on how to effectively utilize Postman for API testing, from basic to advanced concepts.
The course covers various topics, including:
- Introduction to Postman: Understanding the basics of Postman, its features, and how to set up a Postman environment for API testing.
- REST API Testing Fundamentals: Learning the fundamentals of RESTful APIs, including HTTP methods, status codes, headers, and request/response formats.
- Creating and Managing Requests: Understanding how to create and manage requests in Postman, including sending different types of requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), handling request parameters, and working with authentication.
- Handling Responses: Learning how to handle responses from API requests, including extracting and validating response data, handling dynamic data, and using assertions to validate API responses.
- Automated Testing: Exploring the automation capabilities of Postman, including writing and executing automated test scripts using the Postman scripting language, and performing automated API testing.
- Advanced Features: Learning advanced features of Postman, such as working with environments, collections, and workflows, creating and managing mocks and monitors, and integrating Postman with other tools.
- Best Practices: Understanding best practices for API testing, including organizing and managing test cases, using Postman effectively in a team environment, and following industry standards and guidelines.

__Cypress End-to-End Testing - Getting Started__  
*is an online course that provides an introduction to Cypress, a modern JavaScript-based testing framework 
for end-to-end testing of web applications. The course is designed to help learners get started with Cypress 
and build a solid foundation in using Cypress for end-to-end testing.
The course covers the following key topics:
- Introduction to Cypress: Understanding the basics of Cypress, its features, and how to set up a Cypress environment for web testing.
- Writing Cypress Tests: Learning how to write Cypress tests using the Cypress API, including understanding the test structure, writing assertions, 
and interacting with web elements using Cypress commands.
- Handling Different Web Elements: Exploring how to interact with different types of web elements, such as buttons, forms, dropdowns, and checkboxes, 
using Cypress commands.
- Testing Navigation and URL Handling: Understanding how to test navigation and URL handling in web applications using Cypress, including testing page 
redirects, handling URLs, and testing navigation flows.
- Handling Asynchronous Actions: Learning how to handle asynchronous actions in Cypress, such as making API calls, handling delays, 
and waiting for elements to load, using Cypress commands and best practices.
- Testing with Fixtures and Data: Understanding how to use fixtures and data in Cypress to handle test data, including reading data from 
external files, using fixtures for data-driven testing, and handling test data in different scenarios.
- Advanced Topics: Exploring advanced topics in Cypress, such as handling iframes, working with cookies, handling authentication, and 
writing custom commands and utilities.
- Best Practices: Understanding best practices for writing effective and maintainable Cypress tests, including organizing and structuring tests, 
using Cypress effectively in a team environment, and following industry standards and guidelines.
